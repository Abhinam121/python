# Databases and Visualization

\Lecture 5_01 Geocoding

Gathering process: takes long and is unreliable, so you want to store it into a database because the data are solid in the database.

The python program is going to be broken into small little programs, each that does a specific operation in the progress from data gathering to data visualization.

This is personal data mining.

API:
